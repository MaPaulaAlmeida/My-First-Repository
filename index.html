    <h3>Hello, my name is Mar√≠a Paula Basantes Almeida...</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      I was born of the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, on January 9,
      2006. So, currently I am 18 years old. This year has meant a lot of
      changes to me, the biggest one, decide to move abroad and start college. I
      am living and studying at the city of Porto in Portugal, this becoming an
      unforgettable experience at my short age.

    <p style="text-align: justify">
      I have a strong passion for visual arts, reason why my degree in
      <i>Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia</i> is highly related to this
      topic. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, drawing, taking photos
      and hear some music. Also, travelling is a big part of my life; this has
      allowed me to explore new cultures and places. Some of my favorite cities
      in the world are Prague in the Czech Republic, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil,
      and Mexico City in Mexico.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      As part of my life perspective, I appreciate moments of peace and
      tranquility, I am also driven by the excitement of working on large-scale
      projects, especially those that aim to create a positive social impact.
      This balance between calm and ambition helps me stay focus, and inspires
      me to get out my quo zone to develop the best version of myself.
